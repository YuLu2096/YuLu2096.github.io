I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at UC Merced, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Roummel F. Marcia](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/rmarcia/). My research focuses on non-convex optimization, deep learning, and low-photon computer vision. I welcome any comments or questions about my workâ€”feel free to reach out!

Currently, I am completing my Ph.D. dissertation as a visitor at the University of Chicago, where I am deeply grateful to be supported by [Prof. Rebecca Willett](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu). Previously, I earned my B.S. in Mathematics at UCLA, where I had the honor of being mentored by [Prof. Asgar Jamneshan](https://asgarjam.wixsite.com/home) under the guidance of [Prof. Terence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com). I was also a visiting student at Stanford University in 2023.

In Fall 2024, I had the privilege of interning at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) under the guidance of [Dr. Thomas F. Lynn](https://lynntf.github.io) and [Dr. Sven Leyffer](https://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/leyffer/index.php/Sven_Leyffer). I have also been fortunate to collaborate closely with [Dr. Ming Du](https://mdw771.github.io/about/) and [Dr. Zichao Di](https://zichaodi.github.io). During Summer 2024, I interned at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), where I was honored to be supervised by [Dr. Lorenzo Aureli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TljI_7IAAAAJ&hl=it) and [Dr. Frederik Schulz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=rGqwhgkAAAAJ).
